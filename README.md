# Lead-Generation-2.0

The updated version of my outdated dirty clumsy and having shockingly high amount of stars repository - https://github.com/Madi-S/Lead-Generation

# Expectations of this project:

    - Parse Google Maps for telephone number, email, address and other information by given keyword
    - Somehow parse search results for the same information using regex or other algorithm
    - For parsed emails, send them an email, which will be prevented from going to spam
    - Export all parsed data to csv or excel

# Commands

Install browsers `playwright install`

Run in docker `docker build -f Dockerfile . --platform=linux/amd64`
